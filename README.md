# Cocoa Grader

A Discord Bot Grader, more specifically, '*Waifu Discord Bot*'

~~Created to compete with [Cafe Grader](https://github.com/cafe-grader-team/cafe-grader-web)~~

## 🌲 Dependencies

### To Start the Bot

- nodejs (16.9+, discord.js requirement) with npm and yarn

### To make sure no error occurred

- gcc, python3, ghc

- **pshved/timeout** installed to bin, [see here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/44988)

- Use some powerful devices (don't use Raspberry Pi that I use 😖)

## 🏷️ Features

- Functional Grader with Time and Memory Limit (but does not prevent `sudo reboot`, use with caution)

- Beautiful Embed (Embed Supremacy)

### Planned

- Interactive (Library like IOI)

- Better Problem Management System (to be compatible with upcoming [stupid-problems](https://github.com/Leomotors/stupid-problems))

## 🔪 Cutting Edge

Branch `future-lib` contains `cocoa-discord-utils` in the version that is not
published on npm yet. Error will surely occur.
