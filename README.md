# Cocoa Grader

A Discord Bot Grader, more specifically, '*Waifu Discord Bot*'

~~Created to compete with [Cafe Grader](https://github.com/cafe-grader-team/cafe-grader-web)~~

## 🌲 Dependencies

### To Start the Bot

- nodejs (16.9+, discord.js requirement) with npm and yarn

### To make sure no error occurred

- gcc, python3, ghc

- **pshved/timeout** installed to bin, [see here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/44988)

- Use some powerful devices (don't use Raspberry Pi that I use 😖)

## 🏷️ Features

- Functional Grader with Time and Memory Limit (but does not prevent `sudo reboot`, use with caution)

- Beautiful Embed (Embed Supremacy)

### Planned

- Interactive (Library like IOI)

- Better Problem Management System (to be compatible with upcoming [stupid-problems](https://github.com/Leomotors/stupid-problems))

## 🔪 Cutting Edge

Branch `future-lib` (if is ahead of main) contains `cocoa-discord-utils`
in the version that is not published on npm yet. Error will surely occur if you run it.

## 🔧 Adding a problem

Create a folder with problem ID as the name of it

Inside that folder, you should have manifest.json

For schema of manifest.json please look [here](./src/grader/problems.ts) or
at src/problems of [stupid-problems](https://github.com/Leomotors/stupid-problems)
